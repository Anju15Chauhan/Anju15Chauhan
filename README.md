### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Anju Chauhan, a dedicated professional providing GST services from home and currently pursuing a comprehensive data science course. I specialize in data analysis, Python, SQL,Statistics, Numpy, Data analysis, EDA, Pandas, and Machine Learning, and enjoy creating innovative solutions to real-world problems.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a dataset analysis project involving New York house prices and Boston house prices.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in Python, SQL, statistics, NumPy, Pandas, and machine learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science projects and open-source initiatives.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about SQL, data visualization, and statistical analysis.
